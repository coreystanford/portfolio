		<h2><strong>I'm a Toronto-based web developer.</strong></h2>

		<p>A good day is one where I discover something completely new -- ideally on my own through experimenting. I find I learn the most (and have the most fun) when I play with a technology or process.</p>
		<p><strong>The path to meaningful growth and discovery is through play (and hard work).</strong></p>
		<p>I am a keen learner with an eye for details both aesthetic and logical. I enjoy working in a team and accomplishing tasks in deadline-driven environments.</p>
		<p>Having previously run my own business, I am aware of the daily challenge of wearing many hats at once. As a result, I have experience with managing my time effectively, as well as prioiritizing tasks in order to accomplish goals.</p>
		<p>I enjoy making useful things that are as beautiful as they are functional. </p>
